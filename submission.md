# Submission Notes

These notes will be read by HubSpot developers. Drop us a line!

Hi Dev's thanks for the opportunity, hope you guy like it. any question please let me know.

First I would like to tell, my daughter born on 27/05 and i was on the hospital with then till today (30/05).

As you can image i didn't have much time to do. Etheir way that was tha far i could go in this time.

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

I would done webpack set up for dev, prod, and deploy. organise better my scss and create mor mixins.

I also would finish the logic on the filter method for select option.. 

I also should use the font, and particial provided.. but I didn't have much time, overall the react application did the job.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

I though setting up a new project with webpack from scratch would minimize changes of error and time consume. 

I also had to set up reactjs, which is much easier from react creat app

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

I've use a extra API to map the values and diplays as quotes. this will be just after Chuck norris sections.

My only problem for this task was the time, just because i was in the hospital.. eatheir way with the app I've put it up you guys can have an idea how much i achieved in such short time.

Hope you guys like, and if you have any question let me know..

Looking forward work with you guys.

Thanks

Thiago Baptistella
